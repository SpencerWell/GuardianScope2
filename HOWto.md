### HOW TO 


GuardianScope is an innovative, decentralized content moderation protocol designed to address the growing need for fair, transparent, and efficient content moderation in Web3 and decentralized social platforms. Built on EigenLayer's Actively Validated Service (AVS) infrastructure, GuardianScope leverages AI-powered agents and blockchain technology to provide automated, unbiased, and privacy-preserving content moderation.

## Core Problem Addressed
Traditional content moderation systems are often centralized, prone to bias, and lack transparency. These systems can be easily manipulated or censored, leading to unfair outcomes and a lack of trust among users. GuardianScope aims to solve these issues by decentralizing the moderation process, ensuring that decisions are made transparently and fairly, while preserving user privacy.

## How It Works
GuardianScope operates as a decentralized network of AI-powered operators who analyze and moderate content submitted by users or platforms. The protocol uses EigenLayer's restaking mechanism to secure the network, ensuring that operators are economically incentivized to act honestly and efficiently. The moderation process is powered by advanced AI models capable of analyzing multi-modal content (text, images, and videos) in real-time.

## Key Components:
Decentralized Moderation Network:

A distributed network of operators runs AI agents to analyze content.

Operators are staked and incentivized through EigenLayer's restaking mechanism, ensuring economic security and honest behavior.

The decision-making process is transparent and recorded on-chain, making it immune to centralized control or censorship.

## AI-Powered Analysis:

The protocol supports multi-modal content analysis, including text, images, and videos.

AI models, such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) for text and computer vision for images/videos, are used to evaluate content.

The system is adaptable to platform-specific moderation requirements and continuously improves through decentralized governance.

Smart Contract Infrastructure:

GuardianScope uses AVS smart contracts to coordinate moderation tasks, verify on-chain results, and distribute rewards.

The contracts ensure transparency and fairness by recording moderation decisions and operator actions on the blockchain.

EigenLayer Integration:

GuardianScope integrates with EigenLayer's AVS infrastructure, leveraging BLS signatures for efficient consensus and restaking for economic security.

Operators who act maliciously or fail to perform their duties can be slashed, ensuring the integrity of the network.

## User Flow
A content publisher submits content for moderation through the GuardianScope contract.

The GuardianScope contract emits a NewTaskCreated event, signaling a new moderation request.

Staked operators receive the request and process it using their AI models.

Each operator generates a moderation decision (approve/reject), hashes it with the content, and signs the hash.

Operators submit their signed decisions back to the GuardianScope contract.

The contract verifies the operators' eligibility and stake before accepting the submission, ensuring only valid and staked operators can participate.

##  Technical Components
Smart Contracts: The backbone of the protocol, handling task coordination, result verification, and reward distribution.

EigenLayer AVS: Provides the infrastructure for secure and efficient consensus among operators.

AI Agent System: Modular and extensible, supporting multiple AI models for different types of content analysis.

## Local Development and Testing
GuardianScope is designed to be easily deployable for local development and testing. The project provides detailed instructions for setting up a local Anvil chain (Ethereum testnet), deploying the necessary contracts, and running the AI-powered operator application. Developers can test the moderation process by submitting content and observing how the AI agents and smart contracts handle the moderation tasks.

## Future Plans
Testnet Deployment: Support for testnet deployments will be added soon, allowing developers to test the protocol in a more realistic environment.

BLS Signature Architecture: Future updates will migrate to a more efficient BLS signature architecture for improved scalability and security.

Production Readiness: The protocol is currently intended for local development, but plans are in place to make it production-ready for decentralized platforms.

## Why GuardianScope?
GuardianScope is a pioneering solution for decentralized content moderation, combining the power of AI with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. It is designed to empower Web3 platforms with a fair, unbiased, and efficient moderation system that aligns with the principles of decentralization and user sovereignty.
